- **Feature:** Implemented a favicon switcher that dynamically changes the favicon based on the user's system theme (light/dark).
  - Created `favicon-switcher.js` to handle the theme detection and favicon updating.
  - Modified `index.html` to include the new script and update the favicon link element.
